ATM Interface
This is a Java code for an ATM machine. The code is designed to simulate an ATM interface that allows users to perform basic banking transactions such as depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring money between accounts, and viewing transaction history.
The code starts by creating an instance of the Bank class and an instance of the Scanner class to read user input. The run() method is then called to start the ATM interface. The user is prompted to enter their account ID and PIN number. If the ID and PIN are valid, the user is logged in and presented with a menu of options. The user can then choose which transaction they want to perform.
The showTransactions() method displays the transaction history of an account. The withdraw() method allows the user to withdraw money from their account. The deposit() method allows the user to deposit money into their account. The transfer() method allows the user to transfer money from one account to another.
The main() method creates an instance of the Bank class and an instance of the ATM class with the bank as an argument. It then calls the run() method to start the ATM interface.
